# Torch StainTools for Stain Normalization and Augmentation for Histopathological Images

## Description
* Stain Normalization (Reinhard, Macenko, and Vahadane) for pytorch. Input tensors (fit and transform) must be in shape of `NxCxHxW`, with value scaled to [0, 1] in format of torch.float32.
* Stain Augmentation using Macenko and Vahadane as stain extraction.
* Simulate the workflow in [StainTools library](https://github.com/Peter554/StainTools) but use the Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), or optionally, the coordinate descent (CD) to solve the dictionary learning for stain matrix/concentration computation in Vahadane or Macenko (stain concentration only) algorithm. The implementation of ISTA and CD are derived from CÃ©dric Walker's [torchvahadane](https://github.com/cwlkr/torchvahadane)
* No SPAMS requirement (which is a dependency in StainTools).

## Usecase
* For details, follow the example in demo.py
* Normalizers are wrapped as `torch.nn.Module`, working similarly to a standalone neural network. This means that for a workflow involving dataloader with multiprocessing, the normalizer
  (Note that CUDA has poor support in multiprocessing and therefore it may not be the best practice to perform GPU-accelerated on-the-fly stain transformation in pytorch's dataset/dataloader)
