## Description
* Stain Normalization (Reinhard, Macenko, and Vahadane) for pytorch. Input tensors (fit and transform) must be in shape of `NxCxHxW`, with value scaled to [0, 1] in format of torch.float32.
* Stain Augmentation using Macenko and Vahadane as stain extraction.
* Fast normalization/augmentation on GPU with stain matrices caching.
* Simulate the workflow in [StainTools library](https://github.com/Peter554/StainTools) but use the Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), or optionally, the coordinate descent (CD) to solve the dictionary learning for stain matrix computation in Vahadane or Macenko (stain concentration only) algorithm. The implementation of ISTA and CD are derived from CÃ©dric Walker's [torchvahadane](https://github.com/cwlkr/torchvahadane)
* Stain Concentration is solved via factorization of `Stain_Matrix x Concentration = Optical_Density`. For efficient sparse solution and more robust outcomes, ISTA can be applied. Alternatively, Least Square solver (LS) from `torch.linalg.lstsq` might be applied for faster non-sparse solution.
* No SPAMS requirement (which is a dependency in StainTools).

## Benchmark (No Stain Matrices Caching)
* Use the sample images under ./test_images (size `2500x2500x3`). Mean was computed from 7 runs (1 loop per run) using
timeit. Comparison between torch_stain_tools in CPU/GPU mode, as well as that of the StainTools Implementation.
* For consistency, use ISTA to compute the concentration.

### Batchified Concentration Computation
* Split the sample images under ./test_images (size `2500x2500x3`) into 81 non-overlapping `256x256x3` tiles as a batch.
* For the StainTools baseline, a for-loop is implemented to get the individual concentration of each of the numpy array of the 81 tiles.

## Use Cases and Tips
* For details, follow the example in demo.py
* Normalizers are wrapped as `torch.nn.Module`, working similarly to a standalone neural network. This means that for a workflow involving dataloader with multiprocessing, the normalizer
  (Note that CUDA has poor support in multiprocessing, and therefore it may not be the best practice to perform GPU-accelerated on-the-fly stain transformation in pytorch's dataset/dataloader)

* `concentration_method='ls'` (i.e., `torch.linalg.lstsq`) can be efficient for batches of many smaller input (e.g., `256x256`) in terms of width and height. However, it may fail on GPU for a single larger input image (width and height) due to a cuda-related bug reported [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/79191).

## Stain Matrix Caching
As elaborated in the below in the running time benchmark of fitting, computation of stain matrix could be time-consuming.
Therefore, for both `Augmentor` and `Normalizer`, an in-memory (device-specified) cache is implemented to store the previously computed stain matrices (typically with size 2 x 3 in H&E/RGB cases).
To enable the feature, the `use_cache` must be enabled, should you use the factory builders to instantiate the `Normalizer` or `Augmentor`.
Upon the normalization/augmentation procedure, a unique cache_key corresponding to the image input must be defined (e.g., file name).
Since both `Normalizer` and `Augmentor` are designed as `torch.nn.Module` to accept batch inputs (tensors of shape B x C x H x W), a list of cache_keys must be given along with the batch image
inputs during the forward passing:
```
normalizer_vahadane(input_batch, cache_keys=list_of_keys_corresponding_to_input_batch)
augmentor(input_batch, cache_keys=list_of_keys_corresponding_to_input_batch)

```
The next time `Normalizer` or `Augmentor` process the images, the corresponding stain matrices will be queried and fetched from cache if they are stored already, rather than recomputing from scratch.
